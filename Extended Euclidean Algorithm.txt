Extended Euclidean Algorithm: 

Extended Euclidean algorithm also finds integer coefficients x and y such that: 
 => ax + by = gcd(a, b) 
 
	gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,a%b)
	gcd(b,a%b)=bx1+(a%b)y1
	a%b=a-(a/b)*b
	gcd(b,a%b)=bx1+(a-(a/b)*b)y1;
	now 
	ax+by=bx1+(a-(a/b)*b)y1;

From the LHS and RHS we can write 
	x=y1;
	y=x1-(a/b)*y1;
